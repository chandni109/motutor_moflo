1. What is the product’s name (your Mo-Something app)?
MoTutor

2. What is the function + connection?
MoTutor is an AI-assisted lesson planning tool for tutors, teachers, and small education businesses. 
Its main function is to turn simple inputs (subject, topic, level, duration, and objectives) into a 
structured JSON lesson object that can be reused and shared. In a real MoFlo environment, this JSON 
could be connected to downstream tools like Google Docs, PDFs, or learning platforms so that lesson 
plans can be quickly turned into student-facing materials.

3. Why did you choose to make the product?
I chose MoTutor because I’ve seen how much time tutors and small learning centers spend repeatedly
planning similar lessons for different students. Lesson planning is important but also very repetitive,
so it’s a great fit for a semi-automated, AI-assisted workflow. Building MoTutor also let me combine my
interests in education and software development in a way that feels realistic for how MoFlo’s platform
could be used.

4. Why would MoFlo clients (small and medium sized businesses) be interested in and/or use this product?
Small and medium tutoring centers, test-prep companies, and after-school programs need consistent, 
high-quality lessons that different instructors can follow. MoTutor helps them standardize lesson structure,
save prep time, and onboard new tutors more easily. It also creates a simple record of what has been taught,
which can be reused across students and courses. This makes their operations more efficient and scalable,
which is valuable for growing education businesses.

5. What would you improve or change about your new product if you had more time or could work on it in the future?
With more time, I would add full AI-powered generation of objectives, example activities, and quick assessments 
based only on a topic and level. I would also support multi-lesson units so tutors can plan a whole sequence of
classes, add integrations to Google Classroom, and include simple analytics to show which lessons
are used most often and where students may struggle. Finally, I’d add user accounts and persistence so different 
tutors in the same organization can share and collaborate on lesson plans.
